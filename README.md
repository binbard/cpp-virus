## Overview
There are two viruses made for fun in c++

- ### Random Clicks Virus [fake virus] : 
  This virus made for fun clicks randomly almost everywhereeee. 
  I suggest not to try this :)

- ### Nonstop Virus: 
  This was accidently created by me while working on something and I fixed that. So its source is not available;
