## Overview
There are two viruses made for fun in c++

- *Random Clicks Virus [fake virus] *: This virus made for fun clicks randomly almost everywhere. I suggest not to try this :)

- *Nonstop Virus*: This was accidently created by me while working on something. Though it was more a bug to my program. I corrected my program and forgot to save  the bug's code.\
  So its source is not available; Sorry :(
